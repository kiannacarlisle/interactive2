<h2>About Red Planet</h2>
<p>This app is not simply a record for weather on Mars, it also provides data for possible conditions for human habitation in the future. Mars may contain water; one of the essential ingredients for creating life. Red Planet is your personal notification system for the most current conditions, providing first-hand knowledge of this exciting occurrence. </p>
<p>Earth's resources are limited, and may expire within this or the next generation's lifetime. Preparedness and preservation is key, but eventually humanity will have to consider other options for habitation. Mars is the most similar to Earth in this solar system, making it a viable option for the human race. </p>
