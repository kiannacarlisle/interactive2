<p>SNOW PIECE</p>
<p>Think that snow is falling.</br>
	Think that snow is</br>
	falling everywhere all the</br>
	time. When you talk</br>
	with a person, think</br>
	that snow is falling</br>
	between you and on</br>
	the person. Stop conversing</br>
	when you think the</br>
	person is covered by</br>
	snow.</br></br>

	Yoko Ono, 1963 summer</br></br>
